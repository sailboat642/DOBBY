# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

The Title of my project will be 'MUN Delgate Management Helper'

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A web based app that helps with organising Model United Nations Conferences, more specifically my High School MUN. This project is not meant for those taking part in the event, but for those organising it.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

MUNs are a model united nation conference that takes place periodically and are orchestrated by a secretariat. As part of preparation for the MUN the secretariat has to assign schools portfolios to participating schools. This process includes receiving portfolios and their importance from the Chairs of the Committees. Knowing participating schools and their delegation size. Next, assigning these schools the portfolios. Finally, the school sends the names of students along with the portfolio that they give, this list has to be sorted and given to the Chairs.

## If planning to combine CS50's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to CS50, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

1.	The ability to accept input from an user friendly file type (such as .xlsx)
3.	The ability to store data in an easily modifiable file
4.	The ability to assign schools portfolios according to a set criteria
5.	The ability to match delegates to their portfolios
6.	Give output without any repeats and erros

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
In addition to the above:

1. The ability to edit single delgates and portfolios
2. The ability to give output in a user friendly and readable format.


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
In addition to both GOOD and BETTER outcome:

1. The ability to take new committees seperately
2. The ability to take schools in after sorting and not loosing earlier placements
3. Allow individual entrees to the MUN.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will need to look into SQL a little more. Decide if sqlite is the best suited for datamanagment. Learn javascript in order to give dynamically change the contents of the output page (if I incorporate individual search).
Javascript will also allow the user to interact with table and make changes to individuals. I will need to get a better sense of sorting algorithms so I can decide the best way to assign schools to portfolios allowing maximum diversity in each committe.
